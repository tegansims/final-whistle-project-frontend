# final whistle

Final Whistle is an app designed to let sports teams and their fans track their data.

## Features 

Create a team, then create players and games associated with that team. Let your teammates or friends know the team password, and they can then join the final whistle community to log their vote for a game's man of the match, and post comments to share thoughts with other users.

Admins can log scorers, assisters, and, once all votes are in, can calculate and publish the man of the match results, marking the game as completed.

Users can also create and share formations and set plays, using the interactive tactics board.

## Tech used
Built using Ruby on Rails, React and, for the tactics board, the Konva library.
